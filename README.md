# Description

Developing a centralized Train Management Database System for the city of Boston, that facilitates functionalities like searching schedule of train, searching closest stations along with refilling and maintainence of charlie cards, with the aim of improving upon the current system by saving passenger’s time & efforts in the process 


# Objectives

1. Thousands of users use the ‘Charlie card’ everyday to access the trains, however, there is no centralized application that will help the customer to refill their cards and know their current balance without manually doing so from the kiosk 
2. This application facilitates this provision to update balance in their Charlie cards. Also the customer can check their Charlie card value from this application. 
3. It also aims to secure the passenger’s added value in case they happen to lose their physical cards
